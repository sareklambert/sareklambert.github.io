<p><strong>Hey there, I'm Sarek!</strong>

I've been tinkering with code for as long as I can remember. It all started when I was a kid, experimenting with simple websites and discovering the magic of bringing ideas to life on a screen. My first real dive into logic-based design was through RPG Maker XP, which eventually led me to GameMaker — where I truly started learning to code. From there, I gradually taught myself more and more, eventually studying Computer Science. While I enjoyed programming, I realized that path wasn’t quite for me, so I switched to "Animation and Game," a more hands-on game development program where I refined my skills and started working with <strong>Unity</strong>.
    </br></br>
In my free time, I'm working on my passion project, <strong>Tainted Gun</strong>. When I'm not doing that, you can usually find me doing something delightfully nerdy — whether that's LARPing, playing board games, or taking part in game jams with friends from time to time.
    </br></br>
Excited for the journey ahead and eager to bring ideas to life!</p>
