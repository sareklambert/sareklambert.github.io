<strong>Hey there, I'm Sarek!</strong>
I've been tinkering with code for as long as I can remember. It all started when I was a kid, experimenting with simple
    <strong>websites</strong> and discovering the magic of bringing ideas to life on a screen. My first real dive into
    logic-based design was through <strong>RPG Maker XP</strong>, which eventually led me to <strong>GameMaker</strong>
    — where I truly started learning to code. From there, I gradually taught myself more and more, eventually studying
    <strong>Computer Science</strong>. While I enjoyed programming, I realized that path wasn’t quite for me, so I
    switched to <strong>'Animation and Game'</strong>, a more <strong>hands-on game development program</strong> where I
    refined my skills and started working with <strong>Unity</strong>.
    </br></br>
    
In my free time, I'm working on my passion project, <strong>Tainted Gun</strong>. When I'm not doing that, you can
    usually find me doing something delightfully nerdy — whether that's <strong>LARPing</strong>, playing <strong>board
    games</strong>, or taking part in <strong>game jams</strong> with friends from time to time.
    </br></br>

    <strong>Excited for the journey ahead and eager to bring ideas to life!</strong>
