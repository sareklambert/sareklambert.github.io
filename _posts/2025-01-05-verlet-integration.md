### Description
Verlet Integration is a **physics simulation** method used for soft-body dynamics, ropes, and cloth simulation.
I implemented this technique in **GameMaker**, creating a 2D physics library that allows for an easy setup of these simulations.
Originally developed as part of a smaller game project, I later released it publicly on **itch.io**,
where it gained significant traction. Seeing its popularity, I decided to **refactor** the code, improving its structure,
readability, and maintainability while adding comprehensive documentation and examples.
The library now includes helper functions for features like force fields and textured cloth/ropes,
making it more versatile and user-friendly.

To encourage collaboration and further improvements, I made the project **open-source** on GitHub,
allowing anyone to contribute and expand on the project.

### Why it’s in my portfolio
I've included this piece to highlight my ability to produce publicly documented tools for other developers.
It also showcases my experience in researching topics and implementing them in an
engine of my choice - in this case Gamemaker.
By maintaining an accessible and polished library, I demonstrate my commitment to code quality, usability,
and knowledge sharing within the game development community.
