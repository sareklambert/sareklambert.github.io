### Description
<div class="blockText"> {{"
**Verlet Integration** is a **physics simulation** method commonly used for **soft-body dynamics**, **ropes**, and **cloth simulation**.
I implemented this technique in GameMaker by developing a 2D physics **library** that simplifies setting up these
simulations. The library includes expandable classes for basic objects, helper classes for **force fields** and
**connectors**, an example implementation, and a **wireframe** mode for debugging. By chaining multiple simulated objects
together, it’s possible to create dynamic and visually interesting structures for decoration or gameplay features.

### Development process
<div class="blockText"> {{"
I originally developed this library as part of a small game project but later decided to release it **publicly on
itch.io**, where it gained significant popularity. Seeing interest from other developers, I refactored the code to
improve its **structure**, **readability**, and **maintainability** while also adding better **documentation** and examples.
The updated library now includes helper functions for features like force fields and **textured cloth / ropes**, making
it more versatile and **user-friendly**. To encourage collaboration and further improvements, I made the project
**open-source** on **GitHub**, allowing anyone to contribute and expand upon it.

I included this project to showcase how I approach developing an open-source library for other developers.
It follows a clear structure, is well-documented, and comes with an example implementation.
