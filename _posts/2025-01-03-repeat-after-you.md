### Description
<div class="blockText"> {{"
**Repeat after You** expands on last semester’s project, *Repeat after Me*, by introducing a **level editor**
that lets players create and share their own puzzles. Featuring a **custom serialization system**, puzzle objects and
logic gates can be interconnected seamlessly, with levels saved as **JSON** files for easy sharing. The project transforms
the original game into a dynamic, community-driven experience, giving players the tools to craft and challenge each
other with custom levels.
