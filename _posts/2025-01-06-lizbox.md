### Description
<div class="blockText"> {{"
**Lizbox** is a collection of specialized **pixel art tools** I developed for my game projects. The most notable tool is the
**Animation Mask Editor**, which allows users to create **gradient textures** that can be used with **shaders** to produce
unique **2D animations**.
The tool includes features to **simplify gradient visualization**, various **drawing tools**, an action history (**protocol**),
and multiple **export options**, making it both **powerful** and **user-friendly**.

### Development process
<div class="blockText"> {{"
While creating **UI animations** for one of my games, I grew frustrated with how **time-consuming** the process was and
started exploring **alternatives**. Previously, I had used **shader-based transitions** by applying simple gray gradient
textures to **encode time**, revealing and hiding images. However, this method was **imprecise** and could only be applied
to **entire images**.

To **improve precision**, I experimented with **manually** drawing gradients over UI elements to create more dynamic
animations. While the **results were promising**, the **process remained slow**, and the subtle gradient shades were
**difficult to distinguish** by eye. I needed a tool that could **'draw time'** onto a texture while maintaining enough
**contrast between pixels** — but no such tool existed.

So, I built one myself in **GameMaker**. Since **the engine lacked built-in UI support**, I first developed a full **UI
framework** from scratch, including **windows**, **docking**, **scaling**, and other essential features. With this foundation,
I created a drawing tool that automatically cycled through a custom palette, ensuring **clear visual separation**
between gradient steps. I then added **quality-of-life features** like **line drawing**, adjustable **brush sizes**,
**zooming**, an **undo / redo** system (using software design patterns I learned during my studies), **exporting options**, and more.

This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of **UI design** and served as an example of the
**custom development tools** I occasionally create to **streamline** my **workflow**. Additionally, it showcases some of
the simpler 2D **shaders** I’ve worked on.
