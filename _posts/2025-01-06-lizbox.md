### Description
<div class="blockText"> {{"
Lizbox is a **collection** of specialized **pixelart tools** I made for some of my game projects. The most notable tool is the
**animation mask editor**. It lets the user create a **gradient texture** which can be used with a **shader** to create unique **2D
animations**. The tool features a method to visualize the gradient in an easier way, some drawing tools, a protocol, as
well as a couple of export options.

### Development process
<div class="blockText"> {{"
When I created **UI animations** for one of my games I was frustrated with how long the process took and started looking for
**alternatives**. I created shader based animations for transitions before using textures with a simple **gray gradient**
to **encode time**, hiding and revealing images. However, these gradients could so far only be used for entire images and
were very imprecise. I thought about how that could be used for **more precise animation** and manually drew a gradient over
one of my UI elements to create a more interesting animation. That worked well enough, but wasn't much faster. Even worse,
the different shades were so close to each other that they couldn't be distinguished with the naked eye.

I needed a tool which could **draw 'time'** to a texture and let me see enough contrast between pixels, but no
such tool existed. So I created the tool myself in GameMaker. Since the engine had no UI support whatsoever, I first
had to create my own **UI framework** from scratch, featuring windows, docking, scaling and everything else a UI system needs.
With that I implemented a simple drawing tool which automatically **cycles through a palette** designed to reveal the
gradient while having enough contrast to differentiate between single pixels. After that came more **quality of life features**
like a line drawer, brush sizes, zooming, an **undo/redo protocol** using the command pattern which I picked up during my
studies, exporting and more.

The project was a great opportunity for me to learn about UI and an example of the custom **dev tools** I occasionally create
during development which I wanted to include as another piece in here. It also demonstrates some simpler **2D shaders** I've worked on.
